                   Misttail bounded up the rocky path to the moonpool and pushed through the bushes to the stone hollow. “Here we are!” Shadowsight the Skyclan medicine cat meowed as he caught up to him. “The Moonpool.” For the first time since he had heard the ominous words of the prophecy Misttail felt uneasy. He would be leader soon and he'd have a whole clan to look after. He wove his way down to the pool and silently touched his nose to the water. It was unexpectedly cold and he shivered as the chill passed through his body. Was he in Starclan yet? He could still feel the cold stone under him. He opened one eye to check if he was still at the moonpool. And immediately jumped up when he saw the lush green fields of Starclan filled with cats all around him. As he was admiring the enormous ranks of stary pelts, a brown she cat stepped forward. “I am Leafstar. I was leader before Hawkstar.” She meowed. “with this life I give you justice, use it well and be fair to all cats, those who do wrong and those who do what is right.” she bent down and touched her nose to his forehead. sharp pain shot through him and he flinched. Leafstar stepped back and Misttail recognized the ginger pelt of Firestar as he came forward. “With this life I give you leadership and loyalty, use them well to lead your clan.” Misttail braised himself for the pain of the life and was ready when he felt the pain surge through him like thousands of claws ripping at him from the inside. Suddenly Firestar's eyes flicked to something behind Misttail and he gasped. Misttail spun around to see a beautiful pale grey she-cat padding towards him. “I am Bristlefrost.” she meowed quietly. “With this life I give you love, use it well for all your clan and protect them like a mother protects her kits.” She touched her muzzle to his forehead, but as he tensed waiting for the pain he felt a strong wave of warmth ripple over his pelt. Bristlefrost stepped past him to join the starry ranks. Turning back around he came face to face with his old mentor, Rootspring. “With this life I give you mentoring, use it to help train your clan and keep them safe.'' The ferocity of the life hit Misttail like a monster and he almost fell over as pain flooded through him. Rootspring stepped back. A light grey tom bounded up to him “I am Clear Sky,” he meowed, “With this life I give you the respect for borders, remember that they matter even when times are hard.” Misttail closed his eyes to receive this next life, however, as Clear sky’s nose touched him, instead of the sharp pain he was expecting he felt as if he were running not from danger but for fun–so fast nothing could catch him. As Clear sky returned to the rest of Starclan, misttail recognized the yellow pelt of Lionblaze. “With this life I give you the power to be undefeated in battle,” Lionblaze started, “use it well to defeat your enemies.” The monster he had felt with rootsprings life smashed into him again and thousands of cats joined it ripping at his pelt, but it never tore. The pain was infinite and it crushed Misttail down to a small heap of fur cowering under millions of claws and fountains of blood that was not his. When he finally staggered to his paws he was greeted by Hawkstar. “With this life I give you hope, use it to see the light in the darkness of war and death.'' Misttail closed his eyes briefly to receive the life, when he opened them he was face to face with Jayfether. fixing his gaze on Misttail, the old cat meowed. “With this life I give you persistence and use it to continue when all seems lost.” Jayfeather touched his nose to Misttail’s forehead and stepped back beside brackencloud. As his father stepped forward misttail saw a look of deep sadness in his eyes. “With this life I give you acceptance. Use it well when leading gets tough and to accept bad things.” He touched his nose to Misttail’s forehead. He had had doubts about becoming leader but now he was confident he could lead the clan against Echostar. When he opened his eyes he was met by a large, pale blue-grey she-cat. “I am bluestar.” she meowed. “With this life I give you loyalty, not only for your clan but for the other clans too.” she touched her nose to his forehead and stepped back into the crowd of cats. Hawkstar stepped forward again and meowed, “I call you by your new name, Miststar. Your old life is no more. You have now received the nine lives of a leader, and StarClan grants you the leadership of Skyclan. Defend it well; care for the young and the old; honour your ancestors and the traditions of the warrior code; live each life with pride and dignity.” “Miststar, Miststar!”  while Starclan began to chant his new name, miststar closed his eyes and let the sound carry him back to the moon pool.  Miststar opened his eyes and stood up.
