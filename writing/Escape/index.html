                        Torren sat in the damp, wet tent at the ora-Krai camp. After half a year of debating with the strong hold people Yánrak still had not gotten what he wanted. Day after day Torren had watched him become more and more corrupt until he'd cracked. That morning he had led Torren and the ora-krai to the stronghold for one last raid, the final attempt to break their defences.

Yánrak raised the dark knife to the sky and clouds gathered. The ora-krai charged across the farms and burned everything that was living. Kra, the only ora-krai who didn't treat Torren like scum, held him by his shirt as he headed for the main gates. Torren looked up at him—his eyes were dull and under his painted mask he wore a tight frown. It was clear this was not the right life for him. Yánrak's sharp yell tore Torren from his thoughts. It was time. The older man brought the blade to rest across Torren's already scared arm. He closed his eyes, preparing for the pain he knew was coming. The party began chanting—the song's lyrics were harsh and the tune was rough. Suddenly, Yánrak drew the knife back towards him, cutting across Torren's arm and creating a deep wound. Torren screamed, the darkness from the blade seeped into his blood as it poured out onto the ground. The stones were stained red, then black as the blood turned to shadows. The pain was regnant. His blood, pooling on the ground and black from the knife influence, began to flow towards the gate. It crept up the wall and clung to the wood of the frame. The shadows at the edge of the clearing travelled towards them and swarmed the gate which was now a red stained black. Still, the gate stayed firmly closed. Yánrak's growled exasperatedly. Torren closed his eyes. He knew Yánrak wasn't going to stop. His insane uncle would keep going until the gate was open, or Torren was dead. He wished the gate would open. He wished it could all be over. Torren felt Yánrak bring the blade to rest back along his arm, this time further up, and braced from more pain. He wished the gates would open, anything to end the pain. He felt shadows grabbing at his head, the blade pressed against his arm, his blood pooled on the floor. He imagined the darkness in his mind flooding out and opening the gates, or better yet killing the cruel ora-Krai. Yánrak placed the knife back along Torren's arm. Darkness forced into his mind. They were darkness. Shadow was life. Had the knife made its cut yet? Had the gate opened? Yánrak's voice cut through his thoughts and brought him back to the world of sunlight. The gate was open but the knife had barely touched him. The ora-Krai rushed past him into the vulnerable stronghold. Confused, the guards fell as curved blades and spears pierced their chests. Doors slammed as the ora-Krai made their way through the stronghold towards the large manor Torren had called home for most of his life. He looked behind him, there was no one there. no one was watching. He got up from the ground where he had been sprawled and ran towards the trees. He needed to get away from the ora-Krai, he needed to escape the stronghold people—the people who had lied to him his entire life. He had to leave. For the last six months he had been trapped in the Orá-krai camp surrounded by cruel men and the ever growing forces of darkness that seeped from within the blade. Now that he had finally escaped he wanted to get as far away from the stronghold he had once called home and the people of shadow. The forest around him was thinning slowly and the mossy terrain grew rocky and rugged. At last he could see the sky, grey and heavy with clouds. Suddenly, the ground seemed to fall away in front of him—he had reached the east chasm. Torren slowed his run till he was barely walking. He looked down into the abyss—into the shadows. They shifted in silence as the world moved around them. He could feel them. Although there hadn't been a shadow elemental in over a thousand years, he knew he could control them. He knew he had opened the gates, not the blade. Without a second thought, he jumped.
