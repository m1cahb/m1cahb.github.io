                         I don’t really know what a blog is so this will be fun. I guess they are just a huge regularly updated jornal just not about anything too personal because they’re public. Well for anyone who didn’t read the about me part of the home page and just clicked off here: Hi I’m Micah. I’m a thirteen year old christian boy living in New Zealand and I love to Read, write, code, play video games, basically I’m your average nerd kid. I do lots of stuff, I play chess https://www.chess.com/member/flamingcat25 I play minecraft (COLDFIRE25) I make scratch projects (https://scratch.mit.edu/users/voleheart_wc/) I considered making music but while I can write songs I cannot sing. So there you go, extended about me. I have no Idea what to write now. I guess I could share a story about me. If you're wondering what this blog page is I’ll tell you it’s a sucky REKRAP2 commentary with no readers. Anyway story time: last year I went to this easter camp with my church youth group and honestly it was probably the best thing I’ve done since then, I made a few friends and had fun. The camp was three or four days long and every day we would get up at like six or seven in the morning and run around the winery beside the camp. For any people in New Zealand who want to know where it is, it's like Finlay park or some place. (https://www.finlaypark.co.nz/) anyway while we were running we’d talk about what we were gonna do that day, if we were going to do the blob, or if we were going to go gokarting. So one morning I was walking (because running is the last thing you want to do right after you get out of bed) and talking to this kid, I won’t say his name but we’ll call him BLOODSPIDER11 because that's his minecraft username. So I was walking along talking to Bloodspider and we were discussing the activities. Keep in mind I’m a nerd and I never touch grass, I wanted to go do the gokarts and the kayaks but he wanted to do things like the blob and paintball. So my stupid brain being introverted and not wanting to be annoying goes like, Okay! Lets do your thing and I ended up doing lots of really athletic and adrenaline filled activities for the entire day. Actually when we were at the paintball I was so puffed and just not doing well, he looked over at me and was like ‘you okay?’ and despite feeling like I was going to fall over I was like ‘yeah, I’m fine!’ and then we got back to the campsite and I chugged around ten bottles of water. He was like ‘man, you are not okay’. I’m still friends with him and we play on a minecraft server together. He calls it IDK SMP. That was a lame story I had nothing better to write. I still have no Idea what a blog is.
